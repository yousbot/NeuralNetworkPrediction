This project was developed as a side project during my 4th year in engineering school in 2017. It is a simple implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network for time series forecasting, utilizing the Backpropagation algorithm as the learning mechanism. The goal of this project was to gain a better understanding of how neural networks can be applied to time series forecasting tasks.

## Introduction

Time series forecasting is a critical component in various fields, from finance to weather prediction. Neural networks, particularly Multi-Layer Perceptrons, have shown promise in modeling and predicting time series data. This project served as an educational exploration of implementing such a neural network for time series forecasting.

The core idea of this project was to apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network with Backpropagation as the learning algorithm to time series data. The inspiration for this project and the underlying algorithms and concepts were derived from the paper "Artificial Neuron Networks" by Anil K. Jain, J. Mao, and K.M. Mohiuddin, which can be found [here](http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~ajyu/Teaching/Cogs202_sp12/Readings/jain_ann96.pdf).
